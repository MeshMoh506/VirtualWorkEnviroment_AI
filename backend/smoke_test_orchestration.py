"""
End-to-end smoke test for the weekly-cycle orchestration
(app/agents/weekly_cycle.py) — the actual "what happens next" state
machine, driven through the real API exactly like the frontend would, not
direct ORM writes (that's what smoke_test_weekly_cycle.py covers, at the
schema level). Mocked LLM calls, same style as smoke_test_agents.py.

Covers: bootstrapping a Project + Week 1 on the first assign-task call,
releasing subtasks one at a time, idempotency (asking again mid-subtask
doesn't create a duplicate or call the LLM again), and the full
end-of-week cascade (Manager's week_progress review -> HR's behavioral
review -> Week 1 closes -> Week 2 starts) after all 5 subtasks are
approved.

Run: python smoke_test_orchestration.py
