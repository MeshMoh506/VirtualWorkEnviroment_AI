"""
Stage 2 — the agent roundtable (docs/STAGE2_ROUNDTABLE.md). The deeper
version of "more collaborative, not just assigning tasks": instead of
each optional agent posting an isolated comment in parallel
(co_reviewers.py's original behavior), they now discuss the submission
*with each other*, in sequence, each one seeing the Mentor's review and
everything said before it — so a Security Reviewer can pick up on a point
the Data Reviewer raised, agree, disagree, or add to it. The result is an
actual conversation in the task thread, not a stack of monologues.

Then the Manager reads the whole discussion and posts a short synthesis
— what to prioritize, given everything the team surfaced — so the
graduate gets one clear "here's what matters most" rather than being left
to reconcile four voices themselves.

Kept deliberately bounded: one pass around the table (not a free-running
loop), specialists on the small tier (quick, cheap takes), the Manager's
synthesis on the main tier (it's the judgment call that ties it
together). Each agent's turn is best-effort — one failing is skipped, the
rest of the table carries on.
