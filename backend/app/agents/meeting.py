"""
The Meeting Room (/meeting) — a direct, task-free chat with any agent on
the graduate's team: the default three (Manager/Mentor/HR) plus whichever
optional agents they added during onboarding. Unlike
manager.respond_in_thread (which is scoped to a task's comment thread),
this is open-ended: the graduate asks the Manager about their week, the
Mentor for advice, HR about their growth, or an optional agent about
whatever it's meant for — with no task attached. Persisted as ChatMessage
rows, one running thread per (user, agent). The router (routers/
meeting.py) is what actually checks a graduate has an optional agent on
their team before letting them chat with it — see is_on_users_team below.

Each agent answers in its own voice: the default three reuse the same
persona the task-flow agents use, the four optional agents (roster-only
for now, no task-flow module of their own) have a persona defined here
directly, plus whatever shared context (CV, employee file, and — for
grounding — the current project/week) helps any of them give a useful
answer. The model just replies in plain text here; there are no tools to
call in a conversation, so this uses call_agentic with an empty tool list
rather than call_with_tool.
