"""
Mentor agent. Reads a submitted task's submission — a GitHub link, free
text, image/file attachments, or any mix (docs/
STAGE2_MEETING_AND_SUBMISSIONS.md) — writes a structured Review
(metrics_json holds verdict + rubric categories + inline comments — see
tools.SUBMIT_REVIEW_TOOL for the exact contract, matching
frontend/src/lib/reviews.ts's proposed shape), posts a summary message in
the task thread, and moves the task to 'reviewed' — per agents/README.md,
that transition is the Mentor's job, not the graduate's.
