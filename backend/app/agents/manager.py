"""
Manager agent. Jobs, matching agents/README.md and docs/STAGE1_PRODUCT_FLOW.md:
  1. Introduce the graduate's main Project (once, at their very first task).
  2. Plan each Week: one big task broken into 5 subtasks.
  3. Hand out one subtask at a time as a real Task row (no LLM call — the
     plan was already decided in plan_week).
  4. Reply in a task's comment thread when the graduate posts something.
  5. At the end of each Week, write the progress review that HR's
     behavioral review reads alongside.

Nothing here decides *when* to do these — that state machine (bootstrap a
Project, advance to the next subtask, or run the end-of-week cascade) lives
in weekly_cycle.py, which calls into this module's functions in order.
Keeping the "what" (this file) separate from the "when" (weekly_cycle.py)
is deliberate: this file is one LLM call each, easy to reason about in
isolation.
