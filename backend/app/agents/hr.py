"""
HR agent. Two jobs:
  1. `run_rollup` — periodically rolls up a graduate's Mentor review
     history into an updated Employee File (the shared record Manager and
     Mentor also read) plus a standalone SKILLS_ROLLUP Review. Run cadence
     (after every task? weekly?) is still an open decision per
     docs/PROJECT_STATUS.md; this just implements "run it once now."
  2. `run_behavioral_review` — the end-of-week behavioral evaluation
     (attendance, consistency, absence) from docs/STAGE1_PRODUCT_FLOW.md,
     called by weekly_cycle.py right after the Manager's week_progress
     review. Attendance/lateness figures are computed in code from
     existing Task/TaskMessage timestamps ("meaningful progress" days,
     confirmed with Meshari — a status change, submission, or resubmission
     counts, not just opening the app) — the LLM only writes the narrative
     and a rating on top of numbers it's handed, not the figures themselves.

Storage note: EmployeeFile.skills_json / strengths_json / growth_areas_json
are typed `dict` in models.py (so the SQLAlchemy default of `{}` before any
HR rollup stays valid). Each holds `{"items": [...]}` once HR has written to
it — the frontend will need a one-line `.items` unwrap when it's wired to
this instead of its current mock arrays.
