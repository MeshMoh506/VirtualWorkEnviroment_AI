"""
Thin routing layer between the API (routers/agents.py) and the agent
modules. Nothing here talks to the LLM directly — it just calls into
weekly_cycle.py / manager.py / mentor.py / hr.py, so the router doesn't
need to import them directly or know their internals. This is the seam
agents/README.md describes: as Stage 2 adds more tracks and user-
selectable agents, new routing decisions (e.g. "which agent handles this
track") live here, not in the router or in an individual agent module.
